# Models of Conway's Game of Life, and an infection model.

## Game of life
This simulation follows the standard rules of the [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), and can be started from a random initial condition, an oscillating one, or a "glider" through the use of command line arguments: `python game_of_life.py <R|O|G> <grid size>`.
